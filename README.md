This project is to make a Sudoku webapp

Features include:
place or remove numbers from cells
check if number placement is correct
toggle hints
automatically solve
clear entire puzzle
randomly generate valid puzzles

Click the 'Make Puzzle' button to randomly generate a puzzle. This puzzle is not guaranteed to have only 1 solution, but only 1 solution will be treated as 'correct' by the solution. 
Puzzles are generated by taking a solved puzzle, mapping numbers to different numbers randomly, and then removing a number of cells depending on the difficulty. 

Select difficulty to decide how many hint squares will be given. Easy = 40-50 hint squares, Medium = 30-40 hint squares, Hard = 19-26 hint squares

The solve function isn't necessary because of how I approached puzzle generation, but creating this was part of the iterative process of making the project, so I left it in. 
The solve function works through a backtracking algorithm. It iterates through the numbers 1-9 to find a valid number in the current cell. After the first valid number is found, the functinon moves on to the next cell. If no valid number is found for a given cell, it will backtrack and increase the number in that cell until another valid number is found. This is time consuming, but effective for solving a puzzle, assuming a solution exists.
